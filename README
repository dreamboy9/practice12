CPCheat is a Half-Life multiplayer (+mods)
in game modification to enhance the online
gameplay experience.

It is written entirely from scratch in C and
makes use of the Half-Life SDK, which belongs
to Valve LLC. (see sdk.h). Thus the license
in the header of "sdk.h" applies to that file.

The rest is BSD licensed, see LICENSE.

The rest is written by me with bits and pieces
contributed to the community by several people
named below.
If I forgot someone, tell me ASAP!

Currently featured mods:
- Counter-Strike 1.6
- Day of Defeat
- Team Fortress Classic
- Half-Life MP
